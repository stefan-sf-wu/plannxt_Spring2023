## Getting Started (From Zero to Deployed in ... Some Amount of Time)
* be in your dev machine, e.g. a fresh VPS or container (recommend Ubuntu 20+ with >=2 GB RAM)
* fork the repository
* clone your fork
* `cd` into the project folder
* install rbenv with ruby-build: `curl -fsSL https://github.com/rbenv/rbenv-installer/raw/HEAD/bin/rbenv-installer | bash`
* reload profile: `source ~/.bashrc`
* install ruby 3.1.3: `rbenv install 3.1.3`
* set ruby 3.1.3 as the local default version: `rbenv local 3.1.3`
* install bundler: `gem install bundler`
* configure bundler to skip production gems: `bundle config set --local without 'production'`
* install dependencies: `bundle install`
* setup the database: `rails db:migrate`
* prepare the test database: `rails db:test:prepare`
* run rspec tests: `rails spec`
* run cucumber tests: `rails cucumber`
* assert that all tests are passing.  if they are not, find out which are failing and fix them and/or contact the previous team for help in fixing them.  possibly, the failing tests are themselves invalid and can be safely skipped?
* install heroku cli: `curl https://cli-assets.heroku.com/install-ubuntu.sh | sh`
* login to heroku: `heroku login -i`
  * `username: <your username>`
  * `password: <your API key>`
    * [get your API key from your heroku account](https://dashboard.heroku.com/account)
* create an app on heroku: `heroku create [appname]`, where `[appname]` is an optional name for the app
* [create an s3 bucket](https://s3.console.aws.amazon.com/s3/buckets)
* [create iam role for app to access s3 bucket](https://us-east-1.console.aws.amazon.com/iam/home?region=us-east-1)
  * take note of the access key id and secret access key
  * create access policy: in your iam s3 user, under permissions, click add permission, then create inline policy
    * choose `s3` as the service
    * specify the actions allowed:
      * `ListBucket`
      * `PutObject`
      * `GetObject`
      * `DeleteObject`
    * specify bucket resource ARN for the ListBucket action: click add ARN to restrict access
      * put name of your s3 bucket in the bucket name field
    * specify object resource ARN for the PutObject and 2 more actions:
      * put name of your s3 bucket in the bucket name field
      * click any next to object
    * click review policy at the bottom
    * make sure it looks right and then create it
* in `config/storage.yml`, make sure `region` and `bucket` fields match yourt bucket's region and name
* create google oauth2 client id:
  * [go to google cloud apis & services](https://console.cloud.google.com/apis)
  * if you've never been here before, you'll need to make a project first and congifure your oauth consent screen
    * make the project internal
    * only fill in the required fields:
      * name: your app's name
      * email: your email
      * authorized domains: your apps domain, e.g. `appname.herokuapp.com`
      * developer contact info: your email
  * go to credentials, then click create credentials at the top and select oauth client id
    * application type: web application
    * name: your app's name
    * authorized redirect uris, add: `https://appname.herokuapp.com/auth/google_oauth2/callback`
    * take note of the client id and client secret
* remove encrypted credentials that you cannot decrypt: `rm -f config/credentials.yml.enc`
* create and edit new credentials: `EDITOR=nano rails credentials:edit`
  * add AWS access key and secret (the iam s3 user access key id and secret access key)
    ```
      aws:
        access_key_id: ...
        secret_access_key: ...
    ```
  * add google oauth client id and secret
    ```
      GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID: ...
      GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET: ...
    ```
  * save and exit: `ctrl+o`, `ctrl+x`
  * take note of the master key in the console
* save master key to heroku as config var (for security): `heroku config:set RAILS_MASTER_KEY=...`
* configure email account for sending emails
  * use gmail (because why not?)
  * [create an app password](https://support.google.com/mail/answer/185833?hl=en)
* set sendmail config vars on heroku
  * `heroku config:set SENDMAIL_USERNAME=the email address you just created/configured`
  * `heroku config:set SENDMAIL_PASSWORD=the app password you just created`
  * `heroku config:set MAIL_HOST=https://appname.herokuapp.com`
* stage changes: `git add .`
* commit changes: `git commit -m "ready to push to heroku"`
* deploy to heroku: `git push heroku master`
* run migrations on heroku: `heroku run rails db:migrate`
* seed database on heroku: `heroku run rails db:seed`
* poke around the deployed app
* don't forget to also push to your own github repo: `git push`
